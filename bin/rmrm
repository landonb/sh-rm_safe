# Very. Destructive. Remove.

# 2019-04-08: Note: Sometimes you'll want to run `rmrm -- *`,
#   i.e., if any filenames begin with dashes.

# 2019-04-08: This used to be a simple alias:
#
#   alias rmrm='/bin/rm -rf'
#
# but I (lb) want to avoid destructive commands from being
# reachable via up-arrow (because sometimes I alt-tab to
# the wrong terminal window, and then I up-arrow-and-enter
# without thinking!).
# - So now I fiddle with Bash history to store *commented*
#   command, so you cannot accidentally re-execute it!

# 2020-03-14: Moving to own repo, figure I might as well
# check not trying to delete root filesystem or similar.

  /bin/rm -rf -- "$@"

  # Disable (by commenting) the `rmrm` command in the terminal's history.
  #
  # (lb): We could simple delete the history entry, e.g.,
  #
  #           history -d $((HISTCMD-1))
  #           # Also works?:
  #           #   history -d $(history 1)
  #           # (But using HISTCMD reads better.)
  #
  #       but we should leave a harmless breadcrumb instead.
  #
  # Add the user's command to history, but commented!
  #
  # (So that the user at least has a record of their delete,
  # but so that the user does not risk repeating the command
  # accidentally, e.g., from a blindless up-arrow-and-Enter.)
  #
  # NOTE: We cannot simply try to recreate the command, e.g.,
  #         history -s "#rmrm \"$@\""
  #       because Bash will have performed expansion, e.g.,
  #         rmrm -- "*"
  #       will be expanded to all the files in the cur. dir.
  #       So parse the last history entry (which is the current
  #       command, which Bash will replace on the `history -s`).
  history -s "#$(
    history 1 | /bin/sed -E 's/^ +[0-9]+ +[-0-9]+ +[:0-9]+ //'
  )"
